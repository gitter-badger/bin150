###Turning in Assignments

Assignments can be found in the `assignments` directory of the repo. To download and complete assignments, I recommend this workflow:

1. (Do this step only once) Clone the repo to your computer with `git clone https://github.com/utah/bin150`
2. To update the repo, `cd` to the repo directory and run `git pull` 
3. Have fun!
